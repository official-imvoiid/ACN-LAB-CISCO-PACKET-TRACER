# Advanced Computer Network Lab (22CSE529)

This repository contains all completed lab work for the **Advanced Computer Network Lab** course, part of the Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering program at JAIN University. It includes Cisco Packet Tracer experiment files (`.pkt`) and the official lab manual for the course.

The experiments demonstrate both foundational and advanced concepts in computer networking, implemented and simulated using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. All materials are provided for educational purposes only, with specific licensing and distribution guidelines outlined below.

## Lab Experiments Covered

This repository contains Packet Tracer implementations for the experiments outlined in the lab manual. Key topics include:

- **Switch Configuration:** Configuring basic switch commands, implementing port security, and setting up secure passwords.
- **Router Configuration:** Performing initial router setup and executing basic commands.
- **IP Addressing:** Assigning IP addresses to routers and configuring default routes.
- **Static Routing:** Manually configuring routing tables for network connectivity.
- **Dynamic Routing Protocols:**
  - Routing Information Protocol (RIP)
  - Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP)
  - Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)
- **VLANs:** Configuring VLANs, inter-VLAN routing, and VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP).
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Implementing standard and extended ACLs for network security.
- **Network Address Translation (NAT):** Configuring static, dynamic, and port address translation (PAT).
- **Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP):** Setting up HSRP for gateway redundancy and high availability.

The `.pkt` files correspond to these lab exercises and are ready for use in Cisco Packet Tracer.

## How to Use

To run these experiments, you need **Cisco Packet Tracer** installed on your system.

1. Clone or download this repository using a secure connection (e.g., HTTPS or SSH).
2. Open Cisco Packet Tracer (version 8.2 or later recommended for compatibility and security).
3. Navigate to `File > Open` and select the desired `.pkt` file to explore the network topology and configurations.

Ensure your system is protected with up-to-date antivirus software and avoid running `.pkt` files from untrusted sources.
